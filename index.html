    <h2 align="center">About the Workshop</h2>
    <p> Extended realities (XR), including Augmented reality (AR) and
      virtual reality (VR), are emerging technologies with a wide range
      of potential applications, including networking, gaming,
      healthcare, and education. However, as with any new technology,
      AR/VR also introduces new security and privacy challenges. AR and
      VR devices collect a wide range of personal data about users,
      including their physical movements, eye movements, and voice
      recordings. This data can be used to track users' activities,
      identify them, or even infer private attributes like health
      conditions or private preferences. Furthermore, XR applications
      integrate multiple modalities, such as audio, video, and haptic
      data streams, enlarging security and privacy exposure. Since XR
      applications mainly rely on wireless communication, defending them
      against overhearing, data breaches, and malicious actions is
      substantially challenging. </p>
    <h2 align="center"> Scope of SePAR<br>
    </h2>
    The workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners from
    academia, industry, and society to discuss the latest advances in
    AR/VR security and privacy. We will cover a range of topics,
    including: <br>
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Security:</b> Threats to AR/VR systems and applications,
        and defense mechanisms against these threats.</li>
      <li><b>Privacy:</b> Collection and use of personal data in AR/VR
        systems, user privacy controls, and privacy enhancing
        technologies.&nbsp;</li>
      <li><b>Policy and regulation:</b> Legal and ethical implications
        of AR/VR, and potential regulatory frameworks.&nbsp;</li>
      <li><b>In-Network Computing: </b>The goal is to preserve user
        privacy as a default feature of networks <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: <br>
    <ul>
      <li> Studies on the disclosure of threats in XR applications</li>
      <li>Attacks on XR applications and users on the network level <br>
      </li>
      <li>Privacy and utility metrics in the context of VR and AR <br>
      </li>
      <li>Techniques for anonymization or removal of sensitive
        information from XR data streams <br>
      </li>
      <li>Privacy-enhancing techniques for XR networking traffic <br>
      </li>
      <li>Anomaly detection in encrypted XR traffic <br>
      </li>
      <li>Analysis of encryption protocols used in the context of XR on
        all network layers <br>
      </li>
      <li>Privacy policies in the context of XR applications<br>
      </li>
      <li>Privacy preserving as a virtualized network function<br>
      </li>
      <li>Programmable networks for delay-sensitive applications such as
        AR/XR <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    &nbsp;The workshop will feature a mix of invited talks, contributed
    papers, and panel discussions. We encourage submissions of
    high-quality papers that present original research or practical
    experience in any area related to AR/VR security and privacy.
